Hi, its Michael. I am a noob programmer, trying to write stuff that doesn't break, and cry less.

Focus on Javascript, React, Node.js, Python, Django, Ruby, Rails, MongoDB, SQL, and a general interest in computer science as a whole. I am very interested in Object-oriented programming and the works of Alan Kay, Paul Graham(http://www.paulgraham.com/) and Oz Nova(https://ozwrites.com/).

Started, and still currently in the "Valley of despair" of the "Dunning–Kruger curve".
