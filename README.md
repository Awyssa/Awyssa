Hi, I am Michael. I am a noob programmer, trying to write stuff that doesn't break, and cry less.

I am focusing on Javascript, React.js, Next.js and Node.js. I also follow the works of Alan Kay, Paul Graham(http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) and Oz Nova(https://ozwrites.com/).

Started, and still currently in the "Valley of despair" of the "Dunning–Kruger curve".
